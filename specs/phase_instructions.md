Each phase should follow this pattern:

- Read the `specs/implementation_plan.md` 
- Choose what the next step of implementation is based on the checkmarks in implementation plan, and confirm that isn’t already done in src. Confirm with user it's the right thing to work on (if they didn't already tell you which phase to do)
- Check if we already have a phase plan for this step, if so can skip reading architecture doc. If not:
   read `specs/spec_and_acrhcitecture.md` 
  - Write a plan for this phase in `specs/phase_plans/phase[N].md` pulling out additional details from the spec, into a more detailed implementation plan. See `specs/build_phase_plan.md`
    - Order to build (steps)
    - Relevant technical details for each step (extracted from the long spec file, so we can use this smaller file as reference)
    - tests to implement for each test
  - ask me to review and approve plan
- Work without my assistance, continuing until done the phase.
- Build the component, extending the existing project.
- Compile and fix any typing, test, formatting and linting issues using relevant commands (ruff format, ruff check fix). See `CLAUDE.md` for commands. the `uv run ./checks.sh` command should pass without issue, if it has any issues iterate until resolved.
- Self code review your new work for issues.
- Write tests for the the component/step.
- Run tests. Iterate until build and tests pass. See `CLAUDE.md` for commands.
- Mark the step as complete in `specs/implementation_plan.md`. Only edit this file to toggle checkboxes, nothing else.
- Stop after a single phase is done, don’t continue until asked.

Special case: for GCS steps, you may require environment setup. Work with me on test plan using a API key, and pytest marker
